## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor to the creative portfolio website, I want to navigate through a clean, professional landing page that showcases creative work and provides information about the artist/creator, allows me to learn more through an about page, contact the creator, and create an account or log in to access additional features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor arrives at the website, **When** they load the landing page, **Then** they should see an attractive, welcoming interface that showcases creative portfolio content and clearly communicates the site's purpose
2. **Given** a visitor wants to learn more, **When** they click on the about page, **Then** they should see detailed information about the organization/service
3. **Given** a visitor wants to get in touch, **When** they visit the contact page, **Then** they should see a contact form to submit their message
4. **Given** a visitor wants to create an account, **When** they access the registration page, **Then** they should be able to provide necessary information to create an account
5. **Given** an existing user wants to access their account, **When** they visit the login page, **Then** they should be able to authenticate with their credentials
6. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they want to navigate to other sections, **Then** they should have consistent navigation elements available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user submits incomplete registration information?
- How does the system handle failed login attempts?
- What occurs when contact form submissions fail or succeed?
- What occurs when contact form is successfully submitted (success message and confirmation email)?
- How does the navigation behave on mobile devices?
