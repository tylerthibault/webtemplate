```

## Summary
Creative portfolio website with landing page, about, contact, login/register functionality. Features custom session-based authentication using bcrypt password hashing and a "coat hanger" table for secure session management. Built with Flask MVC architecture, SQLite database, and Bootstrap frontend framework.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, bcrypt, Bootstrap CSS/JS  
**Storage**: SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM  
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Web application (desktop and mobile responsive)  
**Project Type**: Flask MVC (single project)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms page load time, support for concurrent users  
**Constraints**: Custom session management (no Flask-Login), 10-minute session timeout  
**Scale/Scope**: Creative portfolio site with user registration and authentication

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ I. MVC Separation of Concerns**: Design follows MVC pattern with controllers handling routes, logic layer for authentication/session management, models for database interactions, templates for presentation.

**✅ II. Thin Controllers & Models**: Controllers will only handle routing and delegation. Authentication logic resides in logic layer. Models handle only ORM concerns.

**✅ III. Database Layer Standards**: Using SQLite for development with SQLAlchemy ORM. Custom coat hanger table follows base model inheritance pattern.

**✅ IV. Template Inheritance**: All pages extend from public.html (landing, about, contact, login/register) base template. Consistent navigation across all pages.

**✅ V. Static Asset Organization**: Bootstrap CSS/JS files already placed in static folders following established structure.

**Status**: ✅ NO VIOLATIONS - All constitutional requirements met

```

**Structure Decision**: Flask MVC architecture selected as it matches the established project structure and constitutional requirements. Authentication logic concentrated in logic layer with custom decorators and session management.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - ✅ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain
   - ✅ All dependencies clearly specified
   - ✅ Integration patterns defined

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   ✅ Research: Custom Flask session management patterns
   ✅ Research: bcrypt password hashing best practices
   ✅ Research: SQLite session table design patterns
   ✅ Research: Bootstrap integration with Flask templates
   ✅ Research: Custom authentication decorators implementation
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/`
3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`
5. **Update agent file** using update-agent-context.sh

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Setup tasks: Project dependencies, database initialization
- Model tasks: User and CoatHanger model creation [P]
- Logic tasks: Authentication service, session management, decorators [P]
- Controller tasks: Route handlers for each page type [P]
- Template tasks: HTML templates extending base templates [P]
- Integration tasks: Form handling, validation, session flow

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Models → Logic → Controllers → Templates
- Dependency order: Database models → Business logic → Routes → Templates
- Parallel execution for independent components

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*
