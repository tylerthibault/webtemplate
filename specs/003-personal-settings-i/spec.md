## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What additional profile fields (if any) should users be able to edit beyond full name, email, and bio? ‚Üí A: Only name, email, bio (no additional fields)
- Q: Should password change functionality be included in the personal settings page? ‚Üí A: Yes, include password change in personal settings

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to view and edit my personal profile information so that I can keep my account details current and accurately represent myself on the platform.

### User Journey
1. User logs into their account
2. User navigates to "Personal Settings" or "Profile Settings"
3. User sees a form displaying their current information (name, email, bio, etc.)
4. User edits one or more fields
5. User saves changes
6. System validates the changes
7. System updates the profile
8. User sees confirmation that changes were saved
9. Updated information is reflected throughout the application

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: View Personal Settings
- **Given** a user is logged into their account
- **When** they navigate to the personal settings page
- **Then** they see a form displaying their current profile information
- **And** all fields are pre-populated with their existing data

#### Scenario 2: Update Full Name
- **Given** a user is on the personal settings page
- **When** they change their full name and save
- **Then** the system validates the new name
- **And** updates the user's profile
- **And** displays a success confirmation
- **And** the new name appears throughout the application

#### Scenario 3: Update Email Address
- **Given** a user is on the personal settings page
- **When** they change their email address and save
- **Then** the system validates the email format
- **And** checks that the email is not already in use
- **And** updates the user's profile immediately
- **And** sends notification emails to both the old and new email addresses
- **And** displays a success confirmation

#### Scenario 4: Update Bio/Description
- **Given** a user is on the personal settings page
- **When** they add or edit their bio text and save
- **Then** the system validates the bio length
- **And** saves the updated bio
- **And** displays a success confirmation

#### Scenario 5: Invalid Input
- **Given** a user is editing their personal settings
- **When** they enter invalid data (empty required field, invalid email format, too long text)
- **Then** the system displays specific validation errors
- **And** highlights the problematic fields
- **And** does not save any changes
- **And** preserves the valid data they entered

#### Scenario 6: Concurrent Edit Detection
- **Given** a user has the settings page open
- **When** their data is modified elsewhere (admin update, another session)
- **And** they try to save changes
- **Then** the system detects the conflict
- **And** displays a warning showing what has changed
- **And** allows the user to review and decide whether to overwrite or reload

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to change email to one already used by another user? ‚Üí System displays validation error preventing the change
- What happens when a user enters extremely long text in bio field? ‚Üí System enforces 500 character limit with client-side and server-side validation
- What happens when a user tries to clear required fields (like name)? ‚Üí System displays validation error requiring the field
- How does the system handle special characters in name or bio fields? ‚Üí System sanitizes input to prevent XSS while preserving valid special characters
- What happens if the user navigates away without saving? ‚Üí System displays unsaved changes warning (NFR-004)
- Can a user cancel changes and revert to original values? ‚Üí Yes, via Cancel button (FR-010)
- What happens when network fails during save operation? ‚Üí System displays error message; user can retry
- What happens when concurrent edits occur? ‚Üí System detects conflict and warns user before allowing overwrite (FR-025, FR-026)
